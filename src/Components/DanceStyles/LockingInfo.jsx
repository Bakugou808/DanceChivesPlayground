        <p>
          Locking is a style of funk dance, which is today also associated with
          hip hop. The name is based on the concept of locking movements, which
          basically means freezing from a fast movement and "locking" in a
          certain position, holding that position for a short while and then
          continuing at the same speed as before. It relies on fast and distinct
          arm and hand movements combined with more relaxed hips and legs. The
          movements are generally large and exaggerated, and often very rhythmic
          and tightly synced with the music. Locking is performance oriented,
          often interacting with the audience by smiling or giving them a high
          five, and some moves are quite comical. Locking was originally danced
          to traditional funk music, such as that produced or performed by James
          Brown. Funk music is still commonly favored by locking dancers and
          used by many competitions such as the locking division of Juste
          Debout. Locking movements create a strong contrast towards the many
          fast moves that are otherwise performed quite continuously, combined
          with mime style performance and acting and other dancers. Locking
          includes many acrobatics and physically demanding moves, such as
          landing on one's knees and the split. These moves often require knee
          protection.

        <h1>History</h1>
        The beginning of Locking can be traced to one man, Don Campbell. In the
        late 1960s he put together several fad dances adding moves of his own
        (known as the "Lock") when performing. The original lock was created by
        accident: Campbell couldn't do a move called the 'Robot Shuffle' and
        stopped at a particular point whilst moving his arms, creating a
        'locking' effect.[1][2] He wasn't able to perform it fluently, for he
        couldn't remember which step to take next. (Even the acting towards the
        audience was spontaneous: when people started laughing at Don because of
        his unfamiliar moves, he responded by pointing at them.) These halts
        soon became popular as Don added them into his performances. The
        resulting dance was called Campbellocking, which was later shortened to
        Locking. In the early 1970s this set off a movement of Locking dance
        groups, notably Campbell's group The Lockers. Other lockers Jimmy "Scoo
        B Doo" Foster, Greggory "Campbellock Jr." Pope, Tony "GoGo" Lewis, Fred
        "Mr Penguin" Berry (a.k.a. Rerun), Leo "Fluky Luke" Williamson, Damita
        Jo Freeman and others also helped set the foundation for the locking
        dance and clothes style. Clothes style can consist of loud striped
        socks, pegged pants that stopped at the knees, bright colorful satin
        shirts with big collars, big colorful bow ties, gigantic Apple Boy hats,
        and white gloves.
