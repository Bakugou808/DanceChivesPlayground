        Afrika bambaataa. Afrika Bambaataa (/ˌæfrɪkə bæmˈbɑːtə/; born Lance
        Taylor,[2][3] April 17, 1957) is an American disc jockey, rapper,
        songwriter and producer from the South Bronx, New York.[4][3] He is
        notable for releasing a series of genre-defining electro tracks in the
        1980s that influenced the development of hip hop culture.[5] Afrika
        Bambaataa is one of the originators of breakbeat DJing and is
        respectfully known as "The Godfather" and "Amen Ra of Hip Hop Kulture",
        as well as the father of electro-funk.[1] Through his co-opting of the
        street gang the Black Spades into the music and culture-oriented
        Universal Zulu Nation, he has helped spread hip hop culture throughout
        the world.[6] On May 6, 2016, Bambaataa left his position as head of The
        Zulu Nation due to multiple child sexual abuse allegations dating as far
        back as the 1970s.[7]

        Cool Herc. Clive Campbell (born April 16, 1955), better known by his
        stage name DJ Kool Herc, is a Jamaican DJ who is credited for
        originating hip hop music in the Bronx, New York City, in the 1970s
        through his "Back to School Jam",[4] hosted on August 11, 1973, at 1520
        Sedgwick Avenue. After his younger sister, Cindy Campbell, became
        inspired to earn extra cash for back-to-school clothes, she decided to
        have her older brother, then 18 years old, play music for the
        neighborhood in their apartment building.[5] Known as the "Founder of
        Hip-Hop" and "Father of Hip-Hop", Campbell began playing hard funk
        records of the sort typified by James Brown. Campbell began to isolate
        the instrumental portion of the record which emphasized the drum
        beat—the "break"—and switch from one break to another. Using the same
        two-turntable set-up of disco DJs, he used two copies of the same record
        to elongate the break. This breakbeat DJing, using funky drum solos,
        formed the basis of hip hop music. Campbell's announcements and
        exhortations to dancers helped lead to the syncopated, rhythmically
        spoken accompaniment now known as rapping. He called the dancers
        "break-boys" and "break-girls", or simply b-boys and b-girls. Campbell's
        DJ style was quickly taken up by figures such as Afrika Bambaataa and
        Grandmaster Flash. Unlike them, he never made the move into commercially
        recorded hip hop in its earliest years.
